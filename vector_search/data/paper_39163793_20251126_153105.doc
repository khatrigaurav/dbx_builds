<h4>Objective</h4>Estimates of the prevalence of Long COVID in the United States or worldwide are imprecise, but millions of people are thought to be affected. No effective treatment exists for the often devastating symptoms of Long COVID. Central Sensitization has been postulated as a causal/explanatory mechanism for developing Long COVID. No treatment to date has targeted Central Sensitization. The present cross-sectional study describes the first 140 patients treated in a multi-component treatment program that targets Central Sensitization to reduce symptom burden, improve functioning, and lower the psychological distress observed in these patients.<h4>Methods</h4>140 patients diagnosed with Long COVID after an extensive medical evaluation were assessed for function, depression, and pain catastrophizing using questionnaires and patient satisfaction measures after completion of a 16-h Cognitive Behavioral Therapy treatment program focused on Central Sensitization.<h4>Results</h4>Upon admission, patients diagnosed with Long COVID were significantly impaired in their ability to function due to their symptoms. Further, 70% of the patients were depressed. Pain catastrophizing was observed in up to 20% of patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Patient satisfaction measures were high for the sample at the end of the treatment program suggesting that a multicomponent treatment program targeting Central Sensitization is acceptable to patients. Further research is needed to explore the effectiveness and durability of this treatment approach.
