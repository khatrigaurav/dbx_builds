{\b\fs28 Abstract}
\par
Long COVID is complex and disabling. Despite emerging therapies, the lack of guidelines and clinician awareness delays treatment. This paper highlights options available now to improve function and quality of life. We call for a symptom-focused, person-centred approach that incorporates lived experience and clinical judgement to bridge the gap between evidence and care. Time alone is not the answer.
