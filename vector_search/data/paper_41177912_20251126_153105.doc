{\b\fs28 Abstract}
\par
This study examines how individuals with long COVID navigate illness experiences when faced with normal test results. Through qualitative analysis of 1,043 posts from r/covidlonghaulers between July 2020 and January 2021, we identified four key themes: overlapping diagnostic possibilities increase confusion, discordance in treatment plans, sustained uncertainty, and challenges to credibility. Our findings reveal how polysemic meanings of normal become sites of tension between biomedical evidence and lived experiences, creating a communicative burden for patients who must advocate for legitimacy and care. The analysis demonstrates how overlapping symptomology with other conditions complicates diagnosis, while patients develop strategies to navigate dismissive healthcare encounters and establish credibility when symptoms persist despite normal results. Reddit served as a vital platform for patients to exchange communication strategies for healthcare encounters and find validation when test results invalidated their experiences. A strength of this study is its ability to capture the experience of people with long COVID at the community's inception through a platform that connected them despite geographical barriers. Our findings provide valuable insights into how patients navigate contested illness experiences and offer concrete pathways for enhancing patient-provider communication around medically unexplained symptoms across various diagnoses.
