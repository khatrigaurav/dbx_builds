{\b\fs28 Abstract}
\par
Many patients experience unique or persistent symptoms several months following the onset of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the causative agent of COVID-19. While this condition is commonly referred to as long COVID, no universally accepted definition exists; therefore, many patients go underrecognized and underreported. Long COVID can involve almost any major organ system and is characterized by widely heterogeneous persistent or recurrent symptoms including fatigue, headache, cough, dyspnea, chest pain, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, and depression. In line with the wide array of symptoms, numerous potential underlying pathophysiologic pathways, including viral persistence, prolonged inflammation, autoimmune reactions, endothelial dysfunction, and dysbiosis of the microbiome of the gut, may contribute to the symptomology of long COVID. Therapy is directed at symptomatic control; however, no pharmacologic treatments are specifically approved for the management of symptoms associated with long COVID. Several common symptoms of long COVID may be managed with nonprescription treatments (pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic). The goal of this review is to provide clinicians with a better understanding of long COVID and review the latest recommendations for managing common mild-to-moderate symptoms with nonprescription treatment options.
