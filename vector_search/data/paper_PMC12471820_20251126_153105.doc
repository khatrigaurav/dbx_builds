{\b\fs28 Abstract}

<i>Background and Objectives</i>: The positive effect of health resort treatment on long COVID symptoms has been demonstrated. However, no previous study has considered therapy duration as a factor determining treatment effectiveness. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether the duration of treatment predicts its effectiveness in individuals with long COVID. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: In this retrospective study, medical records of 119 individuals (68 women and 51 men; mean age 63.04 ± 8.61 years) undergoing health resort treatment for long COVID were analyzed. Participants were divided into two groups based on therapy duration: shorter (Group 1) and prolonged (Group 2). Dyspnea was assessed using the mMRC scale, physical performance with the SPPB, and functional status with the PCFS scale. Additionally, individuals rated symptom severity on 0-10 point scales. <i>Results</i>: Improvement in functional status was greater in individuals with a prolonged stay at the health resort (Group 1: 0.59 ± 0.66 points; Group 2: 1.41 ± 0.65 points; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Changes in the severity of most long COVID symptoms were significantly greater in patients who stayed longer. An extended stay at the health resort was associated with significant improvement in functional status (β = 0.033, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and in most long COVID symptoms, particularly sleep disorders (β = 0.112, <i>p</i> < 0.0001), memory disorders (β = 0.104, <i>p</i> < 0.0001), and headaches (β = 0.103, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). <i>Conclusions</i>: A prolonged stay in a sanatorium exerts a favorable effect on symptom severity in individuals with long COVID. Comprehensive health resort treatment of approximately four weeks is associated with improved functional status and alleviation of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Nevertheless, given the retrospective design of the present study, prospective research is required to validate these findings.
