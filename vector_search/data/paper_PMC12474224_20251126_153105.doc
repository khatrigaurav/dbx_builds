{\b\fs28 Abstract}
\par
The persistent evolution of SARS-CoV-2 necessitates novel antiviral strategies. This study evaluated the anti-HIV prodrugs tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) for repurposing against SARS-CoV-2, assessing key pharmacological indices (CC<sub>50</sub>, EC<sub>50</sub>, cytostatic effect, and therapeutic window). In vitro screening in Vero E6 cells measured cytotoxicity (via CCK-8/MTT assays) and antiviral activity against Kazakh B.1 and Wuhan strains. TDF (50 µg/mL) reduced high viral loads (MOI 2) by ~2 log<sub>10</sub> (100% inhibition), with minimal cytotoxicity (≥75% viability). TAF achieved near-complete suppression (100% inhibition) at 50 µg/mL, exhibiting dose-dependent inhibition (68-100%) at lower viral loads (MOI 0.01). Both prodrugs showed enhanced antiviral activity with prolonged exposure (96 h). Synergy assessments demonstrated favourable combination indices (CI < 1). Electron microscopy confirmed virion integrity post-treatment. These findings highlight TDF and TAF as promising candidates against SARS-CoV-2, with particular potential for targeting lymphoid reservoirs-sites implicated in persistent viral reservoirs that may contribute to long COVID pathogenesis. Further clinical validation is warranted.
