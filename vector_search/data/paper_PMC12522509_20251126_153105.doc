{\b\fs28 Abstract}
\par
<h4>Background</h4>Long COVID is a complex, multisystem syndrome with significant cardiopulmonary implications. Persistent inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and microvascular injury contribute to prolonged symptoms such as dyspnea, chest pain, and exercise intolerance. Despite growing recognition of these complications, the underlying mechanisms of cardiopulmonary interactions remain poorly understood.<h4>Methods</h4>A comprehensive literature search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science covering studies from 2019 to 2025. Keywords included "Long COVID", "cardiopulmonary interaction", "pulmonary fibrosis", "myocardial inflammation", and "endothelial dysfunction". A total of 102 articles were included, comprising 65 original research studies and 37 review articles.<h4>Results</h4>Pulmonary sequelae, such as fibrotic remodeling, persistent hypoxia, and microthrombosis, impose significant strain on the cardiovascular system, exacerbating myocardial inflammation, arrhythmias, and endothelial dysfunction. Shared mechanisms, such as oxidative stress, immune dysregulation, and neurohumoral activation, create a vicious cycle of sustained cardiopulmonary impairment. The disruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) further contributes to systemic vascular dysregulation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A deeper understanding of cardiopulmonary interactions in Long COVID is essential for developing effective management strategies. Targeting inflammatory pathways, restoring endothelial function, and addressing autonomic instability may provide therapeutic benefits. As the long-term impact of this syndrome continues to evolve, further research is needed to refine treatment approaches and mitigate its burden on global health.
