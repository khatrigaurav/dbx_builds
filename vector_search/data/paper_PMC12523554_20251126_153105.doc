{\b\fs28 Abstract}
\par
Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, developed for autoimmune diseases, have been repurposed as potential therapies for severe COVID-19. Growing evidence indicates that their clinical utility is heterogeneous and cannot be generalized as a class effect. In this Perspective, we focus on the clinical evidence base for JAK inhibitors in COVID-19 and emphasize baricitinib as the the only agent with consistent mortality benefit and highlights the need for agent-specific recommendations and individualized treatment strategies.
