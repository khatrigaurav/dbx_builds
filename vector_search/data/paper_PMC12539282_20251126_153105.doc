<h4>Introduction</h4>Long COVID is a significant public health concern. This study aimed to identify the prevalence, impact, and factors associated with long COVID among young people in Victoria, Australia.<h4>Methods</h4>From April to June 2023, we conducted a cross-sectional online survey of people aged 15-29 years. Participants reported if they had ever experienced long COVID (defined as COVID-19 symptoms for more than 4 weeks) and the impact on their daily functioning. We used multivariable logistic regression to compare participants who reported long COVID with participants who reported acute COVID-19.<h4>Results</h4>Among 765 participants, 11.2% reported they had ever had long COVID; however, only 1 in 10 had been diagnosed by a medical practitioner. Compared to those without prolonged symptoms, participants reporting long COVID were younger (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.99), reported worsened general health (aOR: 8.22; 95% CI: 4.34-15.56), expressed greater concern about getting long COVID again (aOR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.09-1.33), and had more family or friends who also experienced long COVID (aOR: 4.43; 95% CI: 1.92-10.19). In the past 4 weeks, 79.1% of participants with current long COVID reported difficulties with performing work, and 79.1% accomplished less than desired.<h4>Conclusions</h4>One in 10 participants aged 15-29 years experienced long COVID, and most reported negative impacts on their daily life. General practitioners should be aware of the high burden of suspected long COVID in young people and consider supports to mitigate its effects on the health and well-being of this population.
