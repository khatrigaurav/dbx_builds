{\b\fs28 Abstract}

<h4>Background</h4>Convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) refers to a series of clinical syndromes in patients with COVID-19 infection that follow the relevant discharge indications but do not fulfill the criteria for a clinical cure, and these patients are discharged from the hospital with residual multifunctional deficits, including coughing, fatigue, and insomnia. Due to the prolonged convalescent COVID-19 infection, patients continue to experience symptoms or develop new symptoms after three months of infection, and some symptoms persist for over two months without any apparent triggers, which has a significant impact on the health status and quality of life of the population. Patients with convalescent COVID-19 lack a definitive pharmacological treatment. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) exhibits a distinct, synergistic effect on the treatment of convalescent COVID-19. However, there exists a limited number of clinical trials on TCM with lower evidence levels in convalescent COVID-19. Therefore, randomized trials are urgently required.<h4>Methods</h4>A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II clinical trial was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Shenlingkangfu (SLKF) granules in treating patients with convalescent COVID-19 and lung-spleen qi deficiency syndrome. Eligible participants were aged 18-75 years, had a confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection following a positive result for COVID-19 via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or rapid antigen test at least six months prior, and satisfied clinical criteria. Individuals with a history of severe pulmonary dysfunction or major liver and kidney illness or those on medications were excluded. Multicenter subjects satisfying all criteria were assigned (1:1) randomly into an intervention group and a control group. After a 2-day adjustment period, a total of 154 participants were randomly divided into an intervention group and a control group. The intervention group was given the SLKF granules orally once a bag, 16.9 g, twice daily, whereas the control group received the SLKF granule simulation at the same dosage. The trial was conducted over 1 month, with assessments performed at baseline and 3 months.<h4>Results</h4>The primary outcomes were the therapeutic efficacy rate and total clinical symptom score. The secondary outcomes included the fatigue self-assessment scale, pain visual analog scale, Pittsburgh sleep quality index, mini-mental state examination, hospital anxiety and depression scale, TCM syndrome score, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and interleukin-6. Three routine examinations, liver and kidney function tests, and electrocardiography were used as safety indicators.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study aimed to verify whether SLKF granules can significantly improve clinical symptoms, including fatigue, loss of appetite, cough, phlegm, and insomnia, in patients with convalescent COVID-19. For a comprehensive investigation, additional clinical trials with larger sample sizes and longer intervention periods are required.Clinical Trial Registration Center NCT1900024524, Registered on 26 January 2024.
