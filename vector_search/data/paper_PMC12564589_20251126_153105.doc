{\b\fs28 Abstract}
\par
Long COVID, also referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is characterized by persistent multi-systemic symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive impairment, and respiratory dysfunction. Accumulating evidence indicates that gut and oral microbiota play an important role in its pathogenesis. Patients with long COVID consistently exhibit reduced microbial diversity, depletion of beneficial short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing species such as <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> spp. and enrichment of proinflammatory taxa including <i>Ruminococcus gnavus</i>, <i>Bacteroides vulgatus</i>, and <i>Veillonella</i>. These alterations may disrupt intestinal barrier integrity, sustain low-grade systemic inflammation, and influence host immune and neuroendocrine pathways through the gut-brain and gut-lung axes. Distinct microbial signatures have also been associated with symptom clusters, including neuropsychiatric, respiratory, and gastrointestinal manifestations. Proposed mechanisms linking dysbiosis to long COVID include impaired SCFA metabolism, tryptophan depletion, microbial translocation, and interactions with host immune and inflammatory responses, including autoantibody formation and viral antigen persistence. Preliminary interventional studies using probiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation suggest that microbiome-targeted therapies may alleviate symptoms, although evidence remains limited and heterogeneous. This review synthesizes current literature on the role of gut and oral microbiota in long COVID, highlights emerging microbial biomarkers, and discusses therapeutic implications. While causality remains to be firmly established, restoring microbial balance represents a promising avenue for diagnosis, prevention, and management of long COVID.
