{\b\fs28 Abstract}
\par
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has posed global medical challenges due to its ability to affect multiple organ systems. Among the post-COVID-19 complications, multisystem inflammatory syndrome has emerged as a severe condition affecting both children (MIS-C) and adults (MIS-A). This review aims to compile and analyze published data to investigate clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and outcomes of MIS post-COVID-19. A comprehensive search of various databases was conducted to identify studies reporting MIS-related complications in pediatric and adult populations post-COVID-19 infection. Screening, data extraction, and cross-checking were performed by two independent reviewers. Only 64 studies met our inclusion criteria, and compiled results revealed that cardiac complications were the predominant manifestation followed by gastrointestinal, hematologic, neurological, and mucocutaneous involvement. Laboratory findings consistently demonstrated elevated inflammatory markers including CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, and IL-6. Most patients required hospitalization, and many needed intensive care; treatment typically involved IVIG, corticosteroids, and biologic therapies. While most patients recovered, a subset experienced persistent complications. These findings highlight the importance of early recognition, multidisciplinary management, and structured follow-up for MIS. Future research is warranted to clarify the underlying mechanisms, risk factors, and long-term outcomes associated with MIS in post-COVID-19 patients.
