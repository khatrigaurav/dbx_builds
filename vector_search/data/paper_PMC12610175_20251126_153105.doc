{\b\fs28 Abstract}
\par
<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Current estimates suggest that 6% of COVID-19 survivors develop a post-viral sequela known as Long COVID. Among those at risk for this sequela, pregnant individuals are a vulnerable patient population, but they are understudied as to the nature of their symptomology and potential adverse outcomes. <b>Methods:</b> This retrospective study evaluated a cohort of 150 pregnant individuals with a history of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, observing for Long COVID symptoms and assessing for adverse outcomes. Of this cohort, 64% identified as Black and/or Latina, which provides a more diverse representation compared to previously published studies. <b>Results:</b> Within this cohort, 26.7% of individuals experienced at least one symptom of Long COVID; subcohorts, which were categorized based on presence or absence of Long COVID symptomology, presented with varying phenotypes. Pain, mental health dysfunction or psychological problems, and fatigue were the predominant symptoms documented for patients who averaged two Long COVID symptoms after at least 30 days following a COVID-19 diagnosis. Different adverse outcomes were higher in frequency among subcohorts, highlighting a need for continued study to explore the nuances of the impact of COVID-19 on this unique and vulnerable population. The most notable trends between subcohorts related to treatment patterns for acute COVID-19, vaccine status, and cesarean delivery rates. <b>Conclusions:</b> By providing a description of the documented health experience for a predominantly non-White cohort of individuals who were diagnosed with an acute SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy, our study contributes to a foundation upon which future studies can build.
