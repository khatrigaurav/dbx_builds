{\b\fs28 Abstract}
\par
In the post-COVID-19 era, understanding the long-term impact of Long COVID on the immune system is essential for deciphering its influence on lung cancer pathogenesis and immunotherapeutic efficacy. This review comprehensively examines how persistent COVID-19 sequelae-manifested as chronic inflammation, pulmonary fibrosis, cytokine dysregulation, and T-cell exhaustion can reshape the lung cancer microenvironment. In addition, the emerging roles of memory B cells and altered neutrophil function in promoting tumorigenesis are discussed. Importantly, we analyze recent clinical evidence suggesting that COVID-19 vaccination may enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, potentially by modulating host immunity. By integrating mechanistic insights with clinical observations, this review aims to illuminate the challenges and opportunities at the intersection of Long COVID and lung cancer treatment, thereby fostering the development of personalized therapeutic strategies in the post-pandemic era.
