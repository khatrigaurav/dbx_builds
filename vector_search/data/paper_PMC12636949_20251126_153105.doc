<h4>Background</h4>Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) improves physical status and symptoms in patients with long COVID, but access to specialised hospital-based centres is challenging. This trial studied the effect of primary care PR on functional exercise capacity and symptoms in patients with long COVID.<h4>Methods</h4>In this pragmatic randomised controlled trial (PuRe-COVID), patients with long COVID were randomised to a 12-week stepwise PR programme in primary care, or to a control group without PR. The primary end point was change in 6 min walk distance (6MWD) from baseline to 12 weeks. Additional outcomes, measured at 6, 12, 24 and 36 weeks, included patient-reported outcomes, physical activity, maximal inspiratory (MIP) and expiratory pressures and hand grip strength.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 76 patients were randomised (PR/control group (n=39/37); mean age 49±13 years). The change in 6MWD at 12 weeks was estimated to be +39 m in the PR group compared with the control group (95% CI (18 to 59), p<0.001). Furthermore, a decrease in Checklist Individual Strength (CIS)-fatigue was found for the PR group (-6 points; 95% CI (-10 to -2), p=0.011). At 12 weeks, patients in the intervention group were more likely to have a clinically significant improvement in 6MWD (OR 5.7, 95% CI (2.0 to 16.1), p=0.001), CIS-fatigue (OR 3.8, 95% CI (1.2 to 12.0), p=0.020), MIP (OR 3.7, 95% CI (1.05 to 12.7), p=0.036) and modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea score (OR 5.2, 95% CI (1.6 to 16.4), p=0.003).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Primary care stepwise individual PR may improve functional exercise capacity, fatigue and dyspnoea in patients with long COVID. It therefore may be a promising treatment option in primary care for patients with long COVID experiencing fatigue and/or respiratory symptoms.<h4>Trial registration number</h4>NCT05244044.
