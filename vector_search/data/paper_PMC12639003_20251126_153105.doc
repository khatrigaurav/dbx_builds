{\b\fs28 Abstract}
\par
Long COVID, defined by symptoms persisting three months post-SARS-CoV-2 infection, presents a significant global health and economic challenge, with global prevalence estimated at 36% (ranging from 1-92%). This brief communication consolidates current knowledge on its economic impacts, including macroeconomic, cost-of-illness, and microeconomic impacts, which are estimated at an average annual burden of $1 trillion globally and $9000 per patient in the USA, with some individuals covering substantial out-of-pocket expenses. Annual lost earnings in the USA alone are estimated at approximately $170 billion. Long COVID was associated with increased unemployment, financial distress, and work impairment for up to three years post-infection. This paper highlights discrepancies in impact estimation methodologies and calls for standardised metrics especially in emerging economies. Key research gaps include the absence of comprehensive longitudinal studies on individual and aggregated economic burden, specific long COVID phenotypes and biomarkers, and cost-effectiveness evaluations of interventions.
